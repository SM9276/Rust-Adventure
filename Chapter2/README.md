## Chapter 2:
notes:

    Variables and References are immutable by default, use 'mut' to be mutable

    Result enumerations varient Ok and Err, Ok has the value, while Err contains 
    why it failed. Use expect to handle the error, the compiler will still compile
    but give a warning.


    use {} in println! statements to print variable values, you can place variable 
    inside {} to print values and use ',' after to evaluate expressions

    gen_range takes inclusive range 1..=100 which means 1 to 100
